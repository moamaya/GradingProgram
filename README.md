# GradingProgram
(C++) Code will take multiple student grades input from a txt file and output the final grades in a separate txt file.

Marlo Amaya

This small project takes input from a txt file. The input process can be improved by asking the user the location of the txt file. 
For now, the location has to be edited before running. The grades have to be separated by spaces, and the final file will be exported to 
the same location of the initial input.

Thank you for checking this out!
